pandoc-novel
=============

This is a template project for writing a novel or story collection as markdown files and building it into both an ePub file and a printable PDF using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/), and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).   This project is a distillation of the code I used to build [my story collection](https://jp-fosterson.medium.com/the-plunge-pool-stories-by-me-8b0c5570df37), and was partly inspired by [Dan Grec's post on how he created his book for publication using LaTeX](http://theroadchoseme.com/how-i-self-published-a-professional-paperback-and-ebook-using-latex-and-pandoc).

You can see example output for[PDF](doc/example.pdf), and [ePub](doc/example.epub).
